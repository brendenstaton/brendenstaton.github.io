            Hello! My name is Brenden Staton and I'm a student at Kettering Fairmont High School. Growing up I was
            always obsessed with sports especially basketball ever since I was 3. Ironically, I didn't find my passion
            until when COVID hit and I lost the ability to play every other sport, so I ended up trying bowling and
            loving it! Although I enjoy bowling the most, I still enjoy playing every other sport I used to play. For
            example, running, basketball, football, and baseball. Now click the "Tell Me About Yourself" link to tell me
            more about you!
